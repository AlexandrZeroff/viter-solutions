# VITER landing page

VITER is a SaaS solution for payment service providers and acquires.

## Project notes

Website was created for JMIND Systems Ltd, as a product page for their Viter solution.\
ReactJS was chosen because of its optimized, easy and fast operation. Also Tailwind CSS was used to speed up development and reduce the code size. Here`s full app code except some ENV variables (for security reasons).

Data sending from form at the website bottom is implemented using a [emailjs-com](https://www.emailjs.com/) library. This gives an opportunity to collect user data and send it via email to website administrator.

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
